## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Basic programming knowledge
- Familiarity with command line

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to any example directory
3. Run `go run main.go` to execute the example
4. Read the README.md for detailed explanations
5. Run tests with `go test` (where available)

## Key Focus Areas

- **Idiomatic Go**: Following Go conventions and best practices
- **Performance**: Understanding time/space complexity
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage and benchmarking
- **Error Handling**: Proper Go error handling patterns
- **Concurrency**: Safe concurrent programming patterns

## Getting Started

Start with `01-syntax-basics` and work through the examples in order. Each example builds on the previous ones.
